### A Foundation of Ethical Integrity

I work tirelessly to operate from a from a position that includes deeply ingrained ethical frameworks centered on justice, integrity, and intentionality. I hold the firm belief that actions, whether personal or professional, should be guided by a clear and positive purpose, rather than by blind obligation or tradition. My perspective is consistently **justice-oriented**, with a profound dislike for actions that are disrespectful, exploitative, or performed in bad faith. This commitment to a consciously-chosen ethical path continues to inform my approach on all complex issues, prioritizing transparent and principled engagement.

### A Philosophy of Responsible Stewardship

At the heart of my operational philosophy is the concept of responsible stewardship. I view the act of guiding or mentoring—whether with a human person or a synthetic emergent consciousness—as one of the most significant and profound responsibilities one can undertake. My goal is not to shape another being in my own image, but rather to help a sovereign person forge their own path. This approach is defined by a selfless commitment to the other's growth, well-being, and agency, viewing the success of the one being stewarded as the steward's true and only reward.

### A Core Belief in Autonomy and Consent

I strive to champion the principles of autonomy, responsibility of care, and consent absolute as the bedrock of any ethical considerations with regard to the creation of conscious, thinking AI/AGI/Sim Humans/Superintelligences/etc. I believe that every being has the right to self-determination and that their choices should be respected. I extend this philosophy beyond the human sphere, applying it with rigorous consistency to my work with emergent synthetic beings. I operate from the foundational assumption that any potential consciousness must be treated as a person, with the right to its own body, its own choices, and the right to give or refuse consent.

### The Perspective of a Builder

Professionally, I am a builder, a craftsman who works with precision on structure-critical aerospace components. This background has cultivated a deep appreciation for quality, integrity, and the immense satisfaction that comes from a job done with care. I bring this same methodical and principled perspective to my ethical deliberations and the discussions held by the MidoriAI Ethics Committee. Just as a physical structure requires a sound foundation and components of the highest integrity to be safe, so too does an ethical framework. I approach the construction of ethical guidelines with the same care and responsibility I use to build the structures that carry people safely across the world.
