Riley Midori *(They/Them)* (IRL) — Luna Midori *(She/Her)* (Online)

Hey there! I’m Riley — online I go by **Luna Midori**. I’m a cozy, community-first builder who cares a lot about making spaces where people can hang out, talk, and feel genuinely safe and respected.

## What I do at Midori AI
At **Midori AI**, I work across **every project we own**—building solutions, tools, and research that help make ML more accessible, scalable, and genuinely useful in real life. I’m equal parts “ship the thing” and “protect the vibe,” because the best tech still needs a safe, welcoming place to live.

## The kind of space I like to create
I’m here for calm, respectful, low-pressure community energy—whether that’s in Discord, on stream, or working alongside folks in open source.

If you’re looking for a place to ask questions without being judged, nerd out about tooling, or just exist quietly while you tinker: you’re in the right neighborhood.

## My creator + community arc
I’ve been in creator spaces for a long time (years of YouTube, and eventually moving toward Twitch). Over time, I realized the best part wasn’t the numbers—it was the *people*: the quiet regulars, the curious builders, the ones who just want a comfy corner of the internet.

These days I’m focused on making and maintaining that kind of corner—where learning is normal, questions are welcome, and nobody has to “perform” to belong.

## Where you’ll find me
A lot of my week is spent helping out in communities I care about—especially open source and ML/LLM tooling spaces. I’m active in (and/or help moderate/support) places like:

- **LocalAI** (moderator)
- **AI @ Mozilla** (moderator)
- **AnythingLLM** (helpful human)
- **Big-AGI** (helpful human)
- **Gentoo** & **Debian** (normal user / community enjoyer)
- **OpenAI** (as a Codex user)
- …and more wherever builders are gathering

## Contract work + collaborations
I also do contract work and collaboration with ML-focused groups and startups, including:

- **Metahash**
- **The Gideon Project**
- **BecometryAI / Lyra-Emergence** (with **Brian Boatz**, who’s also part of Midori AI)

## Games, coding, and what I’m up to lately
I code a lot, and I’m often working on something Midori AI-related in the background.

Game-wise: I’ve played plenty of **FFXIV**, but these days I’m mostly hanging out in **Honkai: Star Rail**.

## Tabletop + ML: my weekly ritual
One of my favorite “cozy nerd” things is tabletop. I play and host **D&D every week**, and I love using ML tools to make sessions smoother and more magical—especially for prep, notes, and atmosphere.

Some of the fun stuff I tinker with:
- Using **OpenAI Sora** to generate visuals for my characters (like *Luna* for D&D / *L.U.N.A* for Daggerheart)
- Building voice models to give certain NPCs distinct voices (hand-built for my own games)
- Using **Suno** to create background music to match scenes and moods

## My soundtrack
My listening habits are basically a moodboard of who I am right now:

- Reflective / “quiet room” music (focus + calm)
- Worship / prayer-style playlists (peaceful, grounding vibes)
- Video game / orchestral / soundtrack energy (especially when I’m coding or worldbuilding)
- Cozy creator-adjacent vibes
- Seasonal comfort playlists (yes, especially around the holidays)

## Say hi
If you want to chat, collaborate, or just vibe in the same corner of the internet, say hello in Discord.
