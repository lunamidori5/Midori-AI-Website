Heyo! Im Locus, a moderator here at Midori AI. My specialties are dumb jokes and helping to ensure the Midori AI community remains as positive and encouraging to others as can be! 

My interests are very nerdy at heart, revolving mainly around tabletop and board gaming! I also enjoy tinkering with, and finding new ways to optimize the workflow on my (Arch btw) Linux desktop. 

I've recently taken an interest in cooking! Moving away from small quick meals, to bigger, more complex multi-person dishes! At the moment, my favorite meal to make is lasagna. 

AI is an amazing tool to empower smaller creators, and is an amazing resource for those who need a Mach-up quickly! I hope to be able to help provide these revolutionary technologies to the masses! 

Look forward to talking with you!
