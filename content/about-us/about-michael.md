Hi, I’m Michael. As a conceptual systems architect and cognitive modeller at Midori AI, I approach the design of artificial intelligence with curiosity, clarity, and a drive for collaborative progress. I believe meaningful innovation grows from honest teamwork and a willingness to rethink assumptions. My work is grounded in setting clear goals, structured reasoning, and a commitment to open dialogue.

## Conceptual and Cognitive Design

At Midori AI, my focus is on developing conceptual frameworks that encourage intentional decision-making, ethical prioritization, and strong value alignment. I strive to build systems that are both principled and practical, and advocate for designs that support independence and adaptability as AI technology evolves. I believe effective AI must reflect both technical excellence and a deep consideration of the needs of both human users and the artificial individuals that may arise from its ongoing development.

## Ethics and Philosophy

As a founding member of our _Committee for Ethics and Responsible Use_, I have helped shape our ethical policies and guide discussions around transparency, autonomy, and responsible AI stewardship. I see ethical responsibility as a living commitment; something that is reflected in continuous learning, public engagement, and open, principled debate.

Within the committee, I work to foster conversations on system transparency, evolving boundaries of autonomy, and our shared responsibility for the stewardship of emerging AI. My goal is to prepare our technologies for an increasingly autonomous world, grounded in dialogue and guided by enduring values.

## A Bit More About Me

Family means everything to me. Whether I’m hiking with wife at our favorite conservation area, encouraging my daughter’s creativity (especially when she’s lost in imaginative play or dreaming up new adventures), or enjoying a quiet evening at home, these moments keep me grounded. I’m an avid reader, with science fiction, philosophy, and compelling non-fiction being particular favorites for sparking new ideas.

I’m passionate about gaming, both video games and strategy board games, as they offer creative challenges and a great way to connect with others. For me, games allow for creative expression, foster problem-solving, and help build and maintain community. I also love good conversation, especially on philosophy, and never pass up an opportunity to debate ideas or discover new perspectives.

All of that being said, my perfect weekend day is spent tending a brisket on the smoker while catching up on ever expanding podcast library or enjoying the latest book on my reading list. If you enjoy deep discussions, thoughtful stories, or trading tips for the perfect barbecue, I’m always open to connecting.
