## Midori AI — Endless-Autofighter

Endless-Autofighter (a.k.a. Midori AI AutoFighter) is a web-based auto-battler that blends tactical party management, elemental systems, collectible characters, and deep progression systems into a compact, replayable experience. Built with a Svelte frontend and a Python Quart backend, the project supports both lightweight local play and optional LLM-enhanced features for narrative and chat.

### Quick snapshot

- Platform: Web (Svelte frontend, Python Quart backend)
- Play mode: Auto-battler / roguelite runs (45-room floors, procedurally-generated maps)
- Key systems: Elemental damage types, DoT/HoT effects, relics & cards, gacha-style recruits, action-gauge turn order
- Deployment: Runs with Docker Compose; optional LLM profiles for CPU/GPU

## Core Features

### Strategic Party Combat
Combat runs automatically, but depth comes from pre-run party composition, relics, and upgrade choices. Party size, element synergies, and relic combinations all materially change how a run plays out.

### Elemental Damage Types and Effects
Each damage type (Fire, Lightning, Ice, Wind, Light, Dark, etc.) is implemented as a plugin providing unique DoT/HoT mechanics and signature ultimates. The system supports stacking DoTs, multi-hit ultimates, and effects that interact in emergent ways.

### Action Queue & Turn Order
Every combatant uses an action gauge system (10,000 base gauge) to determine turn order. Lower action values act first; action pacing and visible action values help players plan and anticipate important interactions.

### Relics, Cards, and Rewards
Wins award gold, relic choices, and cards. Players pick one card (or relic) from curated choices after fights. Relics unlock passive and active synergies and can alter run-level mechanics like rare drop rate (RDR).

### Roster & Character Customization
Playable characters are defined as plugin classes in `backend/plugins/characters/`. Each fighter exposes passives, signature moves, and metadata (`about` and `prompt`) for future LLM integration. An in-game editor lets players distribute stat points, choose pronouns, and set a damage type for the Player slot.

### Procedural Maps & Rooms
Each floor contains 45 rooms generated by a seeded `MapGenerator` and must include at least two shops and two rest rooms. Rooms types include battle (normal/boss), rest, shop, and scripted chat scenes (LLM-dependent).

### Optional LLM Enhancements
When LLM extras are enabled, the game supports:
- LLM-powered chat with party members (per-run scoped memory via ChromaDB)
- Model testing and async model loading
- Player and foe memory for richer interactions

## How to Play (Quick Start)

### Recommended: Docker Compose (easiest)

Prerequisites: Docker & Docker Compose installed.

Standard run (frontend + backend):

```bash
docker compose up --build frontend backend
```

## Deep Dive — Systems & Mechanics

### Combat details
- Foes scale by floor, room pressure, and loop count. Each defeated foe temporarily boosts the run's `rdr` by +55% for the remainder of the battle, increasing relic and gold expectations.
- Boss rooms have increased relic drop odds and unique encounter rules (always spawn exactly one foe).
- Effect hit rate and resistance interact such that very high effect hit rates can apply multiple DoT stacks by looping in 100% hit chunks.

### Damage types and canonical behaviors
- Fire: Scales with missing HP, applies "Blazing Torment" DoT, ultimate scorches all foes at the cost of self-burn stacking.
- Lightning: Pops DoTs on hit and applies "Charged Decay" (stun on final tick); ultimate scatters DoTs and grants Aftertaste.
- Ice: Applies Frozen Wound (reduces actions per turn) and cold wounds with stack caps; big ultimates hit multiple times with scaling.
- Wind: Repeats hits and applies Gale Erosion (reduces mitigation); ultimates strike many targets repeatedly.
- Light / Dark: Support and drain mechanics (heals, shields, HP siphon, and field-wide status effects).

### Progression and economy
- Gold, relics, card picks, and upgrade items form the core progression loop. Shops heal a fraction of party HP and sell upgrade items and cards.
- Pull tickets are extremely rare but can be earned via very low odds; relics and card star ranks can be improved by extremely high `rdr` values.

### Plugin-based architecture
The backend auto-discovers plugin modules (players, foes, relics, cards, adjectives) and wires them through a shared event bus. Plugins expose metadata like `about` and optional `prompt` strings to support future AI features.

## Playable Roster (high-level)

A large roster lives in `backend/plugins/characters/` with defined rarities and special signature traits. Story-only characters like Luna remain encounter-only; others are gacha recruits. See the README and `ABOUTGAME.md` for the full table of characters and signature abilities.
