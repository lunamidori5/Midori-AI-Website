Quick snapshot Platform: Web (Svelte frontend, Python Quart backend) Play mode: Auto-battler / roguelite runs Key systems: Elemental damage types, DoT/HoT effects, relics &amp;amp; cards, gacha-style recruits, action-gauge turn order Deployment: Runs with Docker Compose; optional LRM profiles for CPU/GPU Core Features Strategic Party Combat Combat runs automatically, but depth comes from pre-run party composition, relics, and upgrade choices.</description>
