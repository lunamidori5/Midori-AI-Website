Welcome to Midori AI — we love helping people build, break, and tinker with machine learning. This is a friendly, experimental space for makers, learners, and teams to explore practical tools, try bold ideas, and ship imperfect prototypes. Come mess with models, experiment loudly, and learn together — we’ll help you every step of the way.

### Midori AI recommends Linux for optimal performance and security.

{{% notice style="info" title="Platform Recommendation" %}}
While we understand that some users may have specific preferences that seem to necessitate the use of Microsoft Windows, we strongly recommend that users consider transitioning to Linux. 

Linux offers superior privacy, customizability, and support for open-source software.

Midori AI is committed to creating a safe and empowering space for users to explore, learn, and create with ML, while respecting their freedom and time.

Should you encounter any challenges or require assistance with the transition process, please reach out to [Luna Midori](https://zcal.co/lunamidori/move-to-linux). Luna is available to provide guidance and support to help ensure a smooth and successful migration to Linux.

*Please note that while we are happy to assist with the transition to Linux, we will not provide any support for Microsoft Windows systems.*
