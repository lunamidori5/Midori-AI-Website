      <description>Sophisticated Simplicity The Gideon Project (TGP) is a company dedicated to creating custom personalized AI solutions for smaller businesses and enterprises to enhance workflow efficiency in their production. Where others target narrow and specialized domains, we aim to provide a versatile solution that enables a broader range of applications. TGP is about making AI technology available to businesses that could benefit from it, but do not know how to deploy it or may not even have considered how they might benefit from it yet.</description>
