**How Docker Works**

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package and run applications in isolated and portable environments called containers. Containers share the host operating system kernel but have their own dedicated file system, processes, and resources. This isolation allows applications to run independently of the host environment and each other, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior.

The Midori AI Subsystem extends Docker's capabilities by providing a modular and extensible platform for managing AI workloads. Each AI system is encapsulated within  its own dedicated Docker image, which contains the necessary software and dependencies. This approach provides several benefits:

* **Simplified Deployment:** The Midori AI Subsystem provides a streamlined and efficient way to deploy AI systems using Docker container technology.
* **Eliminates Guesswork:** Standardized configurations and settings reduce complexities, enabling seamless setup and management of AI programs.
