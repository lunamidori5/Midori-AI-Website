### üöÄ **Our Projects**

#### [Midori AI Subsystem Manager](/subsystem/manager)
The `Midori AI Subsystem Manager` is an all-in-one interface designed to simplify the management of multiple AI tools and frameworks. It provides a centralized platform for configuring, monitoring, and integrating various AI subsystems, enabling smoother workflows and greater efficiency for testing / users.

With its user-facing design, the Subsystem Manager bridges the gap between disparate AI tools, helping users focus more on testing / innovation and less on system configuration.

#### [PixelArch OS]({{%relref "pixelos" %}})
Our lightweight OS, built on Arch Linux, is designed for Docker environments. PixelArch optimizes performance, simplifies container management, and supports advanced AI workloads.

#### [Carly: A Fully Simulated Human](/about-us/carly-api)

### Midori AI recommends Linux for optimal performance and security.

{{% notice style="info" title="Notice" %}}
While we understand that some users may have specific preferences that seem to necessitate the use of Microsoft Windows, we strongly recommend that users consider transitioning to Linux. 

Linux offers superior privacy, customizability, and support for open-source software.

Midori AI is committed to creating a safe and empowering space for users to explore, learn, and create with AI, while respecting their freedom and time.

Should you encounter any challenges or require assistance with the transition process, please reach out to [Luna Midori](https://zcal.co/lunamidori/move-to-linux). Luna is available to provide guidance and support to help ensure a smooth and successful migration to Linux.

*Please note that while we are happy to assist with the transition to Linux, we will not provide any support for Microsoft Windows systems.*
